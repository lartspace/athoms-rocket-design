## About the project

It's a `model rocket` design on top of [OpenRocket](https://openrocket.info) 

#### What is OpenRocket?
> OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying them.

## Note

The rocket design used on this project is heavely based on [Apogee Components](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Kits/Skill-Level-4-Model-Rocket-Kits/Katana) `Katana` model rocket.

Mostly adapted for the `Metric System` since it's Brazil's standards. That makes our life easier when finding proper tube sizings.
